# qcfirst

**QCFirst** is a prototype course enrollment application where users (i.e. students and instructors)
can access features to help simulate an online enrollment environment. 

The following application will contain features of: **User Management**, **Course Management**, and **Enrollment Management**.

**User Management** will focus on creating a responsive environment for both students and instructors when
accessing the course enrollment application.

**Course Management** will be managed by instructors and will allow them to create and delete courses through a database.

**Enrollment Management** will focus on allowing students to register for classes for an upcoming semester.



## Site Map
This is the course enrollment's site map. It will contain essential pages to help a user navigate through all of the website's features.
The rest of the README will contain wireframes for each individual page of the site map and will contain additional information about what a user will
be able to do on each individual webpage(depending on whether they are signed in as a user or instructor).
Each wireframe has its own responsive design transitioning from [Webpage -> Tablet -> Mobile] to ensure that the application is accessible on different platforms.
Each arrow on the site map shows which pages are connected to each other via an internal link; for example, a user will be able to navigate to the Login Page and Create account page from the Home Page.
